## Default hooks for pre_build, build, and fossa invocation
##

## pre_build_hook handles local provisioning of build tools and files.
## It could also be for any needed fossa-specific configuration.
function pre_build_hook() {
  repo_url="$1"

  if [[ -r project.clj ]]; then
    configure_lein
  fi
}

## build_hooks is mostly for compiled or combined builds that require make/Rake invocation
## to bring scannable items into the build directory
function build_hook() { true; }

## This should work for most cases but can be changed locally should fossa require additional
## command-line flags
function fossa_hook() { fossa; }
