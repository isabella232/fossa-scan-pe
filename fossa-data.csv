    ""I had a class with Jim Weirich on testing last week and we were
     allowed to choose our testing frameworks. Kirk Haines and I were
     paired up and we cracked open the code for a few test
     frameworks...

     I MUST say that minitest is *very* readable / understandable
     compared to the 'other two' options we looked at. Nicely done and
     thank you for helping us keep our mental sanity.""

    -- Wayne E. Seguin

minitest/test is a small and incredibly fast unit testing framework.
It provides a rich set of assertions to make your tests clean and
readable.

minitest/spec is a functionally complete spec engine. It hooks onto
minitest/test and seamlessly bridges test assertions over to spec
expectations.

minitest/benchmark is an awesome way to assert the performance of your
algorithms in a repeatable manner. Now you can assert that your newb
co-worker doesn't replace your linear algorithm with an exponential
one!

minitest/mock by Steven Baker, is a beautifully tiny mock (and stub)
object framework.

minitest/pride shows pride in testing and adds coloring to your test
output. I guess it is an example of how to write IO pipes too. :P

minitest/test is meant to have a clean implementation for language
implementors that need a minimal set of methods to bootstrap a working
test suite. For example, there is no magic involved for test-case
discovery.

    ""Again, I can't praise enough the idea of a testing/specing
     framework that I can actually read in full in one sitting!""

    -- Piotr Szotkowski

Comparing to rspec:

    rspec is a testing DSL. minitest is ruby.

    -- Adam Hawkins, ""Bow Before MiniTest""

minitest doesn't reinvent anything that ruby already provides, like:
classes, modules, inheritance, methods. This means you only have to
learn ruby to use minitest and all of your regular OO practices like
extract-method refactorings still apply.","MIT","",RubyGem,"https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest",

format are Samba and Trac.

More information about INI files can be found on the [Wikipedia Page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file).

### Properties

The basic element contained in an INI file is the property. Every property has
a name and a value, delimited by an equals sign *=*. The name appears to the
left of the equals sign and the value to the right.

    name=value

### Sections

Section declarations start with *[* and end with *]* as in `[section1]` and
`[section2]` shown in the example below. The section declaration marks the
beginning of a section. All properties after the section declaration will be
associated with that section.

### Comments

All lines beginning with a semicolon *;* or a number sign *#* are considered
to be comments. Comment lines are ignored when parsing INI files.

### Example File Format

A typical INI file might look like this:

    [section1]
    ; some comment on section1
    var1 = foo
    var2 = doodle
    var3 = multiline values \
    are also possible

Usage
-----

Usage is simple:

.. code-block:: python

    import grequests

    urls = [
        'http://www.heroku.com',
        'http://python-tablib.org',
        'http://httpbin.org',
        'http://python-requests.org',
        'http://fakedomain/',
        'http://kennethreitz.com'
    ]

Create a set of unsent Requests:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> rs = (grequests.get(u) for u in urls)

Send them all at the same time:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> grequests.map(rs)
    [<Response [200]>, <Response [200]>, <Response [200]>, <Response [200]>, None, <Response [200]>]

Optionally, in the event of a timeout or any other exception during the connection of
the request, you can add an exception handler that will be called with the request and
exception inside the main thread:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> def exception_handler(request, exception):
    ...    print ""Request failed""

    >>> reqs = [
    ...    grequests.get('http://httpbin.org/delay/1', timeout=0.001),
    ...    grequests.get('http://fakedomain/'),
    ...    grequests.get('http://httpbin.org/status/500')]
    >>> grequests.map(reqs, exception_handler=exception_handler)
    Request failed
    Request failed
    [None, None, <Response [500]>]

Requests is the only *Non-GMO* HTTP library for Python, safe for human
consumption.

**Warning:** Recreational use of other HTTP libraries may result in dangerous side-effects,
including: security vulnerabilities, verbose code, reinventing the wheel,
constantly reading documentation, depression, headaches, or even death.

Behold, the power of Requests:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/user', auth=('user', 'pass'))
    >>> r.status_code
    200
    >>> r.headers['content-type']
    'application/json; charset=utf8'
    >>> r.encoding
    'utf-8'
    >>> r.text
    u'{""type"":""User""...'
    >>> r.json()
    {u'disk_usage': 368627, u'private_gists': 484, ...}

See `the similar code, sans Requests <https://gist.github.com/973705>`_.

Requests allows you to send *organic, grass-fed* HTTP/1.1 requests, without the
need for manual labor. There's no need to manually add query strings to your
URLs, or to form-encode your POST data. Keep-alive and HTTP connection pooling
are 100% automatic, powered by `urllib3 <https://github.com/shazow/urllib3>`_,
which is embedded within Requests.

Besides, all the cool kids are doing it. Requests is one of the most
downloaded Python packages of all time, pulling in over 7,000,000 downloads
every month. You don't want to be left out!

Release History
---------------

2.10.0 (2016-04-29)
+++++++++++++++++++

**New Features**

- SOCKS Proxy Support! (requires PySocks; $ pip install requests[socks])

**Miscellaneous**

- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.15.1.

2.9.2 (2016-04-29)
++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Change built-in CaseInsensitiveDict (used for headers) to use OrderedDict
  as its underlying datastore.

**Bugfixes**

- Don't use redirect_cache if allow_redirects=False
- When passed objects that throw exceptions from ``tell()``, send them via
  chunked transfer encoding instead of failing.
- Raise a ProxyError for proxy related connection issues.

2.9.1 (2015-12-21)
++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Resolve regression introduced in 2.9.0 that made it impossible to send binary
  strings as bodies in Python 3.
- Fixed errors when calculating cookie expiration dates in certain locales.

**Miscellaneous**

- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.13.1.

2.9.0 (2015-12-15)
++++++++++++++++++

**Minor Improvements** (Backwards compatible)

- The ``verify`` keyword argument now supports being passed a path to a
  directory of CA certificates, not just a single-file bundle.
- Warnings are now emitted when sending files opened in text mode.
- Added the 511 Network Authentication Required status code to the status code
  registry.

**Bugfixes**

- For file-like objects that are not seeked to the very beginning, we now
  send the content length for the number of bytes we will actually read, rather
  than the total size of the file, allowing partial file uploads.
- When uploading file-like objects, if they are empty or have no obvious
  content length we set ``Transfer-Encoding: chunked`` rather than
  ``Content-Length: 0``.
- We correctly receive the response in buffered mode when uploading chunked
  bodies.
- We now handle being passed a query string as a bytestring on Python 3, by
  decoding it as UTF-8.
- Sessions are now closed in all cases (exceptional and not) when using the
  functional API rather than leaking and waiting for the garbage collector to
  clean them up.
- Correctly handle digest auth headers with a malformed ``qop`` directive that
  contains no token, by treating it the same as if no ``qop`` directive was
  provided at all.
- Minor performance improvements when removing specific cookies by name.

**Miscellaneous**

- Updated urllib3 to 1.13.

2.8.1 (2015-10-13)
++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Update certificate bundle to match ``certifi`` 2015.9.6.2's weak certificate
  bundle.
- Fix a bug in 2.8.0 where requests would raise ``ConnectTimeout`` instead of
  ``ConnectionError``
- When using the PreparedRequest flow, requests will now correctly respect the
  ``json`` parameter. Broken in 2.8.0.
- When using the PreparedRequest flow, requests will now correctly handle a
  Unicode-string method name on Python 2. Broken in 2.8.0.

2.8.0 (2015-10-05)
++++++++++++++++++

**Minor Improvements** (Backwards Compatible)

- Requests now supports per-host proxies. This allows the ``proxies``
  dictionary to have entries of the form
  ``{'<scheme>://<hostname>': '<proxy>'}``. Host-specific proxies will be used
  in preference to the previously-supported scheme-specific ones, but the
  previous syntax will continue to work.
- ``Response.raise_for_status`` now prints the URL that failed as part of the
  exception message.
- ``requests.utils.get_netrc_auth`` now takes an ``raise_errors`` kwarg,
  defaulting to ``False``. When ``True``, errors parsing ``.netrc`` files cause
  exceptions to be thrown.
- Change to bundled projects import logic to make it easier to unbundle
  requests downstream.
- Changed the default User-Agent string to avoid leaking data on Linux: now
  contains only the requests version.

**Bugfixes**

- The ``json`` parameter to ``post()`` and friends will now only be used if
  neither ``data`` nor ``files`` are present, consistent with the
  documentation.
- We now ignore empty fields in the ``NO_PROXY`` environment variable.
- Fixed problem where ``httplib.BadStatusLine`` would get raised if combining
  ``stream=True`` with ``contextlib.closing``.
- Prevented bugs where we would attempt to return the same connection back to
  the connection pool twice when sending a Chunked body.
- Miscellaneous minor internal changes.
- Digest Auth support is now thread safe.

**Updates**

- Updated urllib3 to 1.12.

2.7.0 (2015-05-03)
++++++++++++++++++

This is the first release that follows our new release process. For more, see
`our documentation
<http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/community/release-process/>`_.

**Bugfixes**

- Updated urllib3 to 1.10.4, resolving several bugs involving chunked transfer
  encoding and response framing.

2.6.2 (2015-04-23)
++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fix regression where compressed data that was sent as chunked data was not
  properly decompressed. (#2561)

2.6.1 (2015-04-22)
++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Remove VendorAlias import machinery introduced in v2.5.2.

- Simplify the PreparedRequest.prepare API: We no longer require the user to
  pass an empty list to the hooks keyword argument. (c.f. #2552)

- Resolve redirects now receives and forwards all of the original arguments to
  the adapter. (#2503)

- Handle UnicodeDecodeErrors when trying to deal with a unicode URL that
  cannot be encoded in ASCII. (#2540)

- Populate the parsed path of the URI field when performing Digest
  Authentication. (#2426)

- Copy a PreparedRequest's CookieJar more reliably when it is not an instance
  of RequestsCookieJar. (#2527)

2.6.0 (2015-03-14)
++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- CVE-2015-2296: Fix handling of cookies on redirect. Previously a cookie
  without a host value set would use the hostname for the redirected URL
  exposing requests users to session fixation attacks and potentially cookie
  stealing. This was disclosed privately by Matthew Daley of
  `BugFuzz <https://bugfuzz.com>`_. This affects all versions of requests from
  v2.1.0 to v2.5.3 (inclusive on both ends).

- Fix error when requests is an ``install_requires`` dependency and ``python
  setup.py test`` is run. (#2462)

- Fix error when urllib3 is unbundled and requests continues to use the
  vendored import location.

- Include fixes to ``urllib3``'s header handling.

- Requests' handling of unvendored dependencies is now more restrictive.

**Features and Improvements**

- Support bytearrays when passed as parameters in the ``files`` argument.
  (#2468)

- Avoid data duplication when creating a request with ``str``, ``bytes``, or
  ``bytearray`` input to the ``files`` argument.

2.5.3 (2015-02-24)
++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Revert changes to our vendored certificate bundle. For more context see
  (#2455, #2456, and http://bugs.python.org/issue23476)

2.5.2 (2015-02-23)
++++++++++++++++++

**Features and Improvements**

- Add sha256 fingerprint support. (`shazow/urllib3#540`_)

- Improve the performance of headers. (`shazow/urllib3#544`_)

**Bugfixes**

- Copy pip's import machinery. When downstream redistributors remove
  requests.packages.urllib3 the import machinery will continue to let those
  same symbols work. Example usage in requests' documentation and 3rd-party
  libraries relying on the vendored copies of urllib3 will work without having
  to fallback to the system urllib3.

- Attempt to quote parts of the URL on redirect if unquoting and then quoting
  fails. (#2356)

- Fix filename type check for multipart form-data uploads. (#2411)

- Properly handle the case where a server issuing digest authentication
  challenges provides both auth and auth-int qop-values. (#2408)

- Fix a socket leak. (`shazow/urllib3#549`_)

- Fix multiple ``Set-Cookie`` headers properly. (`shazow/urllib3#534`_)

- Disable the built-in hostname verification. (`shazow/urllib3#526`_)

- Fix the behaviour of decoding an exhausted stream. (`shazow/urllib3#535`_)

**Security**

- Pulled in an updated ``cacert.pem``.

- Drop RC4 from the default cipher list. (`shazow/urllib3#551`_)

2.0.1 (2013-10-24)
++++++++++++++++++

- Updated included CA Bundle with new mistrusts and automated process for the future
- Added MD5-sess to Digest Auth
- Accept per-file headers in multipart file POST messages.
- Fixed: Don't send the full URL on CONNECT messages.
- Fixed: Correctly lowercase a redirect scheme.
- Fixed: Cookies not persisted when set via functional API.
- Fixed: Translate urllib3 ProxyError into a requests ProxyError derived from ConnectionError.
- Updated internal urllib3 and chardet.

2.0.0 (2013-09-24)
++++++++++++++++++

**API Changes:**

- Keys in the Headers dictionary are now native strings on all Python versions,
  i.e. bytestrings on Python 2, unicode on Python 3.
- Proxy URLs now *must* have an explicit scheme. A ``MissingSchema`` exception
  will be raised if they don't.
- Timeouts now apply to read time if ``Stream=False``.
- ``RequestException`` is now a subclass of ``IOError``, not ``RuntimeError``.
- Added new method to ``PreparedRequest`` objects: ``PreparedRequest.copy()``.
- Added new method to ``Session`` objects: ``Session.update_request()``. This
  method updates a ``Request`` object with the data (e.g. cookies) stored on
  the ``Session``.
- Added new method to ``Session`` objects: ``Session.prepare_request()``. This
  method updates and prepares a ``Request`` object, and returns the
  corresponding ``PreparedRequest`` object.
- Added new method to ``HTTPAdapter`` objects: ``HTTPAdapter.proxy_headers()``.
  This should not be called directly, but improves the subclass interface.
- ``httplib.IncompleteRead`` exceptions caused by incorrect chunked encoding
  will now raise a Requests ``ChunkedEncodingError`` instead.
- Invalid percent-escape sequences now cause a Requests ``InvalidURL``
  exception to be raised.
- HTTP 208 no longer uses reason phrase ``""im_used""``. Correctly uses
  ``""already_reported""``.
- HTTP 226 reason added (``""im_used""``).

**Bugfixes:**

- Vastly improved proxy support, including the CONNECT verb. Special thanks to
  the many contributors who worked towards this improvement.
- Cookies are now properly managed when 401 authentication responses are
  received.
- Chunked encoding fixes.
- Support for mixed case schemes.
- Better handling of streaming downloads.
- Retrieve environment proxies from more locations.
- Minor cookies fixes.
- Improved redirect behaviour.
- Improved streaming behaviour, particularly for compressed data.
- Miscellaneous small Python 3 text encoding bugs.
- ``.netrc`` no longer overrides explicit auth.
- Cookies set by hooks are now correctly persisted on Sessions.
- Fix problem with cookies that specify port numbers in their host field.
- ``BytesIO`` can be used to perform streaming uploads.
- More generous parsing of the ``no_proxy`` environment variable.
- Non-string objects can be passed in data values alongside files.

- Major proxy work thanks to @Lukasa including parsing of proxy authentication
  from the proxy url
- Fix DigestAuth handling too many 401s
- Update vendored urllib3 to include SSL bug fixes
- Allow keyword arguments to be passed to ``json.loads()`` via the
  ``Response.json()`` method
- Don't send ``Content-Length`` header by default on ``GET`` or ``HEAD``
  requests
- Add ``elapsed`` attribute to ``Response`` objects to time how long a request
  took.
- Fix ``RequestsCookieJar``
- Sessions and Adapters are now picklable, i.e., can be used with the
  multiprocessing library
- Update charade to version 1.0.3

=====
ijson
=====

Ijson is an iterative JSON parser with a standard Python iterator interface.


Usage
=====

All usage example will be using a JSON document describing geographical
objects::

    {
      ""earth"": {
        ""europe"": [
          {""name"": ""Paris"", ""type"": ""city"", ""info"": { ... }},
          {""name"": ""Thames"", ""type"": ""river"", ""info"": { ... }},
          // ...
        ],
        ""america"": [
          {""name"": ""Texas"", ""type"": ""state"", ""info"": { ... }},
          // ...
        ]
      }
    }

Most common usage is having ijson yield native Python objects out of a JSON
stream located under a prefix. Here's how to process all European cities::

    import ijson

    f = urlopen('http://.../')
    objects = ijson.items(f, 'earth.europe.item')
    cities = (o for o in objects if o['type'] == 'city')
    for city in cities:
        do_something_with(city)

Sometimes when dealing with a particularly large JSON payload it may worth to
not even construct individual Python objects and react on individual events
immediately producing some result::

    import ijson

    parser = ijson.parse(urlopen('http://.../'))
    stream.write('<geo>')
    for prefix, event, value in parser:
        if (prefix, event) == ('earth', 'map_key'):
            stream.write('<%s>' % value)
            continent = value
        elif prefix.endswith('.name'):
            stream.write('<object name=""%s""/>' % value)
        elif (prefix, event) == ('earth.%s' % continent, 'end_map'):
            stream.write('</%s>' % continent)
    stream.write('</geo>')


Backends
========

Ijson provides several implementations of the actual parsing in the form of
backends located in ijson/backends:

- ``yajl2_cffi``: wrapper around `YAJL <http://lloyd.github.com/yajl/>`_ 2.x
  using CFFI, this is the fastest.
- ``yajl2``: wrapper around YAJL 2.x using ctypes, for when you can't use CFFI
  for some reason.
- ``yajl``: deprecated YAJL 1.x + ctypes wrapper, for even older systems.
- ``python``: pure Python parser, good to use with PyPy

You can import a specific backend and use it in the same way as the top level
library::

    import ijson.backends.yajl2_cffi as ijson

    for item in ijson.items(...):
        # ...

Importing the top level library as ``import ijson`` uses the pure Python
backend.


Acknowledgements
================

Python parser in ijson is relatively simple thanks to `Douglas Crockford
<http://www.crockford.com/>`_ who invented a strict, easy to parse syntax.

The `YAJL <http://lloyd.github.com/yajl/>`_ library by `Lloyd Hilaiel
<http://lloyd.io/>`_ is the most popular and efficient way to parse JSON in an
iterative fashion.

Ijson was inspired by `yajl-py <http://pykler.github.com/yajl-py/>`_ wrapper by
`Hatem Nassrat <http://www.nassrat.ca/>`_. Though ijson borrows almost nothing
from the actual yajl-py code it was used as an example of integration with yajl
using ctypes.","BSD-3-Clause","Multi-license: MIT OR BSD-3-Clause",Pip,"https://github.com/isagalaev/ijson",

     paired up and we cracked open the code for a few test
     frameworks...

     I MUST say that minitest is *very* readable / understandable

    -- Wayne E. Seguin

minitest/test is a small and incredibly fast unit testing framework.
It provides a rich set of assertions to make your tests clean and
readable.

minitest/spec is a functionally complete spec engine. It hooks onto
minitest/test and seamlessly bridges test assertions over to spec
expectations.

minitest/benchmark is an awesome way to assert the performance of your
algorithms in a repeatable manner. Now you can assert that your newb
co-worker doesn't replace your linear algorithm with an exponential
one!

minitest/mock by Steven Baker, is a beautifully tiny mock (and stub)
object framework.

minitest/pride shows pride in testing and adds coloring to your test
output. I guess it is an example of how to write IO pipes too. :P

minitest/test is meant to have a clean implementation for language
implementors that need a minimal set of methods to bootstrap a working
test suite. For example, there is no magic involved for test-case
discovery.

    ""Again, I can't praise enough the idea of a testing/specing
     framework that I can actually read in full in one sitting!""

    -- Piotr Szotkowski

Comparing to rspec:

    rspec is a testing DSL. minitest is ruby.

    -- Adam Hawkins, ""Bow Before MiniTest""

classes, modules, inheritance, methods. This means you only have to

format are Samba and Trac.

More information about INI files can be found on the [Wikipedia Page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file).

### Properties

The basic element contained in an INI file is the property. Every property has
a name and a value, delimited by an equals sign *=*. The name appears to the
left of the equals sign and the value to the right.

    name=value

### Sections

Section declarations start with *[* and end with *]* as in `[section1]` and
`[section2]` shown in the example below. The section declaration marks the
beginning of a section. All properties after the section declaration will be
associated with that section.

### Comments

All lines beginning with a semicolon *;* or a number sign *#* are considered
to be comments. Comment lines are ignored when parsing INI files.

### Example File Format

A typical INI file might look like this:

    [section1]
    ; some comment on section1
    var1 = foo
    var2 = doodle
    var3 = multiline values \
    are also possible

Rake has the following features:

* Rakefiles (rake's version of Makefiles) are completely defined in
  standard Ruby syntax.  No XML files to edit.  No quirky Makefile
  syntax to worry about (is that a tab or a space?)

* Users can specify tasks with prerequisites.

* Rake supports rule patterns to synthesize implicit tasks.

* Flexible FileLists that act like arrays but know about manipulating
  file names and paths.

* A library of prepackaged tasks to make building rakefiles easier. For example,
  tasks for building tarballs and publishing to FTP or SSH sites.  (Formerly
  tasks for building RDoc and Gems were included in rake but they're now
  available in RDoc and RubyGems respectively.)

* Supports parallel execution of tasks.","MIT","",RubyGem,"https://github.com/ruby/rake",
